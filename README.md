I have set up the initial architecture of a decentralized commodity trading platform. It includes:

Core dependencies:

Web3 library for blockchain integration
State management via Zustand
UI components via React and Tailwind CSS
Decimal.js for precise number handling
Basic layout:

Responsive navigation via sidebar
Dashboard with key metrics
Paths for markets, trades, portfolios, and settings
Component structure:

Modular components for reusability
Responsive design via Tailwind CSS
Icon integration with Lucide React
You can continue implementing specific features like (and implement any additional requirements you want):

Market data integration
Trading interface
Wallet connection
Order book implementation
Portfolio tracking
